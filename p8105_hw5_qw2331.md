## Problem 1

**Load the data**

``` r
homd_df <- read_csv(
  "./data/homicide-data.csv",
  na = c("", "Unknown"))
```

**A brief description**

``` r
# Using summary or glimpse
summary(homd_df)
```

-   This dataset contains `52179` observations and `12` variables with
    `4` numeric variables and `8` character variables.
-   Of all variables, the key ones are:
    -   `uid` is unique id for each observation;
    -   Variables including
        `victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex`
        contain the basic demographic information about each victim;
    -   Variables like `city, state, lat, lon` represent the location of
        the killing;
    -   Variable `disposition` includes values like
        `Closed without arrest, Closed by arrest, Open/No arrest`. A
        homicide to be considered as `Closed with arrest` when police
        reported that to be the case, while `Closed without arrest`
        means there is sufficient evidence but an arrest is impossible.
        And all other cases were classified as `Open/No arrest`.

**Data mutation**

``` r
homd_df %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    unsolved = as.numeric(disposition != "Closed by arrest")
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    ttl_homicide = n(),
    unsol_homicide = sum(unsolved)
  )
```
